This project is a C++ implementation of TCA : triggers, conditions and actions. This formalism allows easy modelling of decisions rules that can be expressed as : when something happens (i.e., a trigger if fired) a set of condition is checked ; if all conditions are true then a set of actions is performed. This formalism allows to express decisions rules in a way that's clearer than nested if blocks and that can easily be implemented in many languages. The current implementation allows to generate the TCA at runtime and to execute it quickly.

An example of code can be seen in the example.cpp file.
