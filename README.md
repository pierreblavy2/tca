# TCA
TCA is a simple formalism that allows to model decisions rules as triggers, conditions and actions.

When something happens (i.e., a trigger if fired) a set of condition is checked ;  
if all conditions are true then a set of actions is performed.

This formalism allows to express decisions rules in a way that's 
clearer than nested if blocks and that can easily be implemented in many languages.
